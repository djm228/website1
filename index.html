            <p>I made this website as a fun project. The goal is to create a website using only HTML and CSS. No JavaScript. No frameworks. It may not be as visually appealing as other websites, but it is guaranteed to be compatible with any modern browser, even if JavaScript is turned off.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textcontain-body">
            <p>I have added a link to my resume, which can be viewed on a desktop browser and downloaded on a mobile browser, as well as a link to the first website I published.</p>            
        </div>
        <div class="textcontain-body">
            <p>I made the first website using Bootstrap 5.0. While it is visually appealing, I had no idea what I was doing. The code is a mess. The purpose of that website is to show my projects from a Technical Writing class I took at Alfred State College</p>
